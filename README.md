The Age Identifier App was created as a way for me to gain experience in API implementation and the full range of front end aswell as backend web development. 

This app along with the backend counterpart to it include a register and sign in feature linked to a local database. It also includes many CSS and styling properties to display my knowledge of different CSS libraries such as tachyons. 

The general purpose of the app is that after you sign in you can input any image url from google and have the Clarafai API make a predicition of the age of any person in a picture. After the submit button is clicked the front end connects with the database to give your user id one more entry. This then reflects on the entry count on the users screen.

This app has fully functioning features when run locally.
